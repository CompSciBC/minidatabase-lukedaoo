CS300 – LD – Fall 2025

* Challenges *
- The structure and naming of variables in Engine.h are not clear to me (idIndex and lastIndex).
If I could, I would like to rename them to something more descriptive, such as:
idIndex to dbIndexById
lastIndex to dbIndexByLastName
prefixByLast to findByPrefixLastName

- Regarding the prefixByLast function, I’m still unsure about the correct approach to compute the upper bound.
In C++, it is true that "a" < "b" and "smi" < "smj". I wrote test cases to verify this behavior.

* What I Learned *
- Callback and lambda techniques in C++ are really interesting. I still need to learn more about them.
They are much cleaner than function pointers!
- GitHub Actions: I created a script (based on your script - just change the test file name) so it now runs my custom test cases as well.
